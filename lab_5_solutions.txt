1.  background-color: red
    use #div1 {}

2.  The margin changes the amount of space around the element from the other elements
    Padding changes the space between the outside of the element and the interior elements

3.  If the margin is greater than 100px it pushes the paragraph element outside the original element and the background is hidden.
    If the padding is greater than 100px, it makes the paragraph element bigger.
4.  The overflow scroll option adds scroll bars to access the internal elements that are bigger than the top level element
    Hidden is an option that hides the parts bigger than the original element.

5.  Float left start the elements on the left and puts them beside each other.
    Float right starts the elements on the right and put them beside each other.
6.  As float: left is added,the elements are moved to the left of the screen and lined up in order.
    the clear: right didn't do anything as it was added...

7.  div1 has float: left
    div2 has float: left
    div3 has clear: left

8.  Changing the body margin to 0 pulls all the elements to the edge of the browser window.  There is clearly some default margin for the body.
